Write a program that finds out number of all possible bracketings using N pairs of brackets (). For example, for N=3 there exist 5 such bracketings:

()()()  
(())()  
()(())  
(()())  
((()))  
On a standard input, the program reads one integer N determining number of bracket-pairs. The result (one integer, too) shall be written on standard output. Note that the answer may be larger than 33 000.
